# Setup and Initial Instructions:

1. If this is the first time running this script, first update `R` and `Rstudio` (these are separate installations):
    - Follow the two steps at this [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), be sure to select the versions of `R` and `Rstudio` that match your computer's operating system.
2. Open/De-compress the `SCAG_data_task.zip`, open the folder "/SCAG_data_task", here are the folders and files that it will contain and below is a directory tree to show the full structure: 
    - `SCAG_data_task.Rmd` is the main file that contains all the R code to download, clean produce the
    - `SCAG_data_task.Rproj` is an R project file that is necessary to reproduce the file paths for all the code, used with R package `here`. Double clicking on this file will launch `Rstudio` as this R project.
    - `SCAG_data_task.html` is the walk through documentation that contains these instructions and all of the commentary inside this file `SCAG_data_task.Rmd` that is outside R code chunks.
    - The "/data" folder contains all of the raw ACS PUMS data both for the 5 year estimates of 2021 and 2022.
    - `data_cleaning_ACS.R` is a reference code for the data cleaning/new variable creation that takes place later in this file `SCAG_data_task.Rmd`.
    - The "/data_dictionaries" folder contains data dictionaries for reference both for the 5 year estimates of 2021 (`pums_vars_acs5_2021.csv`) and 2022 (`pums_vars_acs5_2022.csv`) and for new variables created for this analysis (`ACS_data_new_vars_tbl.csv`).
    - `style.css` is styling for the html output of `SCAG_data_task.html` (not necessary to know what this is).
    - "/images" folder contains screenshots for reference.
    
Directory Tree Diagram for folder "SCAG_data_task": 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = ".")
```

3. Once you have opened and inspected the the folder "/SCAG_data_task", Open the R project file named `SCAG_data_task.Rproj` by double-clicking on it, this will launch your Rstudio as an R project, then open the `SCAG_data_task.Rmd` by going to File, Open, click on R markdown file `SCAG_data_task.Rmd` inside folder 'SCAG_data_task'. R markdown files are like R scripts that allow for adding text in between R code which is contained inside code chunks like this: 

4. Once the file `SCAG_data_task.Rmd` is open inside your Rstudio instance of the R project named `SCAG_data_task.Rproj`, scroll down to the first R code chunk named `setup` (code line # 40), Run this code chunk by clicking on the green arrow run button on the right-hand side of the code chunk like this: ![Running R code chunk](images/run_code_chunk.png)
    - If this code chunk runs, you are ready for the walk through on Monday.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
### Set R chunk options:
# Set default options for R code chunks:
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = FALSE, 
    warning = FALSE, 
    message = FALSE,
    rows.print = 20 # display 20 rows for output of tibbles/tables inline code chunks and in document
    )
# Prevents sci notation and sets the output of decimals to 4 (0.0000), suppresses warnings/info for tidyverse:
options(scipen = 999,
        tidyverse.quiet = TRUE,
        dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE,
        pillar.print_min = 40
        )

# First install the package named "remotes", if it is not already installed in order to use the next line (remotes::update_packages()):
if (!require("remotes")) {install.packages("remotes")}
# The function remotes::update_packages() will install a package if not installed and then if it is installed it will update the packages, if updates exist.
remotes::update_packages(c("here", "rstudioapi", "magrittr", "curl", "fs", "tools", "knitr", "spatstat", "openxlsx2", "data.table", "tidycensus", "tidyverse")) 

# Set here() location- Working directory (root for all relative paths) will then be based on the project folder of the current file:
here::i_am(basename(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))

### Load libraries:
library(here) # package to manage file paths
library(magrittr) # pipe function package
library(openxlsx2) # writing excel files and manipulating excel workbooks.
library(data.table) # package for data manipulation and reads in large files faster using fread()
library(tidyverse) # package loads all tidyverse packages like dplyr, tidyselect, stringR, etc.

### Functions ----
### weight_perc_table()

### Download data from US Census American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site:

- The first step is retrieving the .csv files that make up both 5 year estimates from 2017-2021 and 2018-2022.
- The next code chunk will download each of the zip files for the housing and person level data, both for the 5 year estimates from 2017-2021 and 2018-2022. 
- This code can be changed to retrieve the 2023 data once it is released in 2025.
- These files are located on the US Census American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) [File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2021/5-Year/)
- Links for 2017-2021 files:
    - Housing 2017-2021 PUMS .csv data link (clicking link will download the full large file): https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2021/5-Year/csv_hca.zip
    - Person 2017-2021 PUMS .csv data link (clicking link will download the full large file): https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2021/5-Year/csv_pca.zip
- Links for 2018-2022 files: 
    - Housing 2018-2022 PUMS .csv data link (clicking link will download the full large file): https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2022/5-Year/csv_hca.zip

- To get the URL's for the desired .zip files, go to the FTP site, click on the desired year for the 5-year estimates.
    - The file name convention is `{file type}_{h=housing/p=person}{state abbreviation}.zip`, e.g. `csv_hca.zip` is a .csv file, for housing level data for the state of California (CA).
    - Right click on the .zip file and click "Copy Link Address".  
- This process takes about 5 minutes to download all files depending on your internet connection and can be skipped if you have the full .zip drive with the data files already downloaded.

### Load and Clean raw ACS PUMS FTP data

- This section will read in the raw data for the housing level data and person level data, selecting only the necessary variables for each with the given lists.
- Then, the files are merged- keeping all observations from the person level data and adding the columns from the housing data where SERIALNO matches, the merged data is then written out to a .csv file.
- The merged data is then filtered to the SCAG region, adding a county variable, and new variables created for later analysis as described in the previous section and in more detail in the file `data_cleaning_ACS.R`. 
- Finally, the merged and cleaned data is written to a .csv file.
- This process is repeated for both the 2017-2021 and the 2018-2022 ACS PUMS in the next two code chunks, the only difference is that the 2022 data in the 2018-2022 ACS PUMS has PUMA's drawn from the 2020 census (PUMA20), so this variable needed to be combined with the 2010 PUMA's (PUMA10) to create an overall PUMA variable (PUMA).

# Analysis and Replication of Tables and Figures for SCAG

- Each of the following code chunks will create a table to match the figures from the Equity Analysis report or RECBR and write it out to a .csv file to the folder `output/tables`.
- Below is a brief description of each table and the data it includes.

## Tables and Figures from Equity Analysis Technical Report- (EA report)

### Figure 5. Workers who Commute by Walk, Bike, or Public Transit by Race and Ethnicity

- Percentage of Workers who Commute by Walk, Bike, or Public Transit.
- Uses person level weights, excludes person who work from home. 

```{r fig_5}
# Figure 5. Workers who Commute by Walk, Bike, or Public Transit by Race and Ethnicity:
# Use person level weights- PWGTP; walk_bike_public_transport ==  "Walk/Bike/Public"
# Get percentages based on non-home workers- drop all if JWTRNS respond == 11 (use filter not equal to 11 like this (filter(JWTRNS != 11)))
# Use weight_perc_2groups():
# Pass in data filtered to only hh (filter(RELSHIPP == 20)), calculate weighted percentages using hh level weights- "WGTP", for variable "poverty" and filter to "poverty" == "Yes": 
walk_bike_public_scag_table <- ca_pums_scag %>% filter(JWTRNS != 11) %>%

                        group1_levels = county_levels, group2_levels = race_levels) %>% rename(walk_bike_public_percentage = percentage)
walk_bike_public_scag_table

# Write out table to .csv in "output/tables" folder and once the file exists remove from current environment all tibbles used to make the final table:
write_csv(walk_bike_public_scag_table, here(tables_fp, "walk_bike_public_scag_table.csv"))

### Figure 6. Householders without a Vehicle by Race and Ethnicity

- Percentage of Households without a Vehicle.
- Uses household level weights, includes only housing level data.

```{r fig_6}
# Figure 6. Householders without a Vehicle by Race and Ethnicity:
# Filter to only housing data(RELSHIPP == 20) and Use household weights- WGTP; sum over VEH == 0; Use weight_perc_2groups():

### Figure 7. Workers’ Commute Times (Minutes) by Mode and Race and Ethnicity

- Workers’ Commute Times in Minutes by Mode of transportation, three categories:
    - Workers who Commute by bus, rail, taxi, or ferry: coded "Public"
    - Workers who Commute by Car or Motorcycle: coded level "Private"
    - Workers who Commute by Walk, Bike, or Other: coded level "Other"   
- Uses person level weights, excludes person who work from home.
